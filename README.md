# HR_Salary_Prediction
The aim of this project is to create a model for HR professionals that predicts salaries by utilizing a comparative approach. 
This will be accomplished by evaluating multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN),
 and decision tree Model. By comparing the outcomes of these models, the best suited model
for our salary prediction data will be identified.
