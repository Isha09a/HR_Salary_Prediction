# RIO-125-HR-Salary-Dashboard---Train-the-Dataset-and-Predict-Salary
The aim of this project is to create a dashboard for HR professionals that predicts salaries by utilizing a comparative approach. 
This will be accomplished by evaluating multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Model, and Gaussian Model. By comparing the outcomes of these models, the best suited model
for our salary prediction data will be identified.
